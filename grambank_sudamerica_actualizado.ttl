    rdfs:comment """The term ‘labileʼ is the most commonly used label for verbs which can be used transitively or intransitively without any formal change.\r
A distinction is made between patient lability, more commonly referred to as [P](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P))-lability, and agent lability or [A](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Core-arguments-(S,-A-and-P))-lability.\r
P-lability stands for patient-preserving lability, that is, the P argument is preserved in the intransitive construction, as in _I broke **the stick**_[P] / _**The stick** broke_. A-lability stands for agent-preserving lability, that is the A argument is preserved in the intransitive construction, as in _**John**_[A] _drinks tea / **John** drinks_. \r
\r
This question asks only about P-labile verbs. Semantically, two things can happen with P-labile verbs. In case of (a) argument structure modifying P-lability, an otherwise transitive verb is used in the intransitive construction encoding an argument structure from which the A argument of the transitive construction is absent. In case of (b) less common argument structure preserving P-lability, the verb in its intransitive use implies the same participants with the same roles as in its transitive use, but in the intransitive use, the A argument is not expressed and is interpreted as non-specific.""" .

There are four possible codes for this feature, reflecting the fact that the collective universal quantifier might occur strictly before or strictly after the noun, may be allowed in both of these relative positions, or may not be present in a language. A 0 code is also applicable when the language does not allow a basic construction with an adnominal collective universal quantifier and a noun (e.g. if only a floating construction is used).\r

Items that can occur as lexical stems in light-verb constructions are: (1) nouns (e.g. *do baby* in Ivorian English or *have sex* in English for ‘to copulate’), (2) adjectives (e.g. *make beautiful* in English), (3) non-inflectable items such as ideophones (e.g. *do ssss* for ‘to make an ssss sound’), or (4) verbs borrowed from other languages that do not inflect in the target language. \r
\r
Regular verbs cannot occur as lexical stems in light-verb constructions, in the Grambank definition. This makes light verb constructions different from serial verb constructions and verbal compounding, which involve a sequence of more than one verb. Another difference is that there is a predicate-argument relationship between the light verb and the other lexical stem (e.g. in *do baby*, *baby* is the object of *do*), while in serial verb constructions the verbs do not have a predicate-argument relationship between them since they instead describe a sequence of events.""" .

\r
Serial verbs are different from verb compounds, in that they are compositional: "a serial verb construction must be a productive schematic\r
CONSTRUCTION such that the meaning of a concrete construct can be determined on the basis of the meanings of its parts and the construction meaning. This means that non-compositional combinations of verbs do not fall within the definition." By contrast, verbal compounds are lexicalized and often non-compositional.  \r
\r
Serial verb constructions are also defined in Grambank as different from clause-chaining. Clause chaining involves a series of verbs which are not inflected, and one verb which is (see [GB150](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB150)). A serial verb construction is defined using Haspelmath's definition above, but in addition where it is not an example of clause chaining (i.e. it is not true that there is an inflected verb and the other verbs are missing inflection).  It is however possible for a language to have both serial verb constructions and clause chaining.\r
\r
Serial verb constructions are also different from light verb constructions, which are made up of a verbal element and a lexical stem which is not an inflected verb, jointly determining argument structure (see [GB123](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/GB123)).  \r
\r
'Verb' here refers to words that can be used as independent verbs in the language in question; but it is also best if they are dynamic verbs, as per the definition in Haspelmath (2016), 'Verbs are defined as dynamic event expressions that do not have special coding when used in predication function'. Serial verb constructions which are more restricted than that, such as only applying to stative verbs (e.g. a verb meaning 'good'), should not be counted as 1.""" .

    rdfs:comment """Clause-chaining involves sequences of medial clauses (i.e. formally reduced or restricted clauses that do not have the full marking that usually occurs on the verb) which are dependent on a single, fully inflected verb that often (but not always) occurs in final clause. Clause chains may also be referred to as topic chains or as sequences of medial clauses/medial verbs. Crucially, this construction involves a single clause with a full, unrestricted, finite verb form and medial clauses that are dependent on it for specification of inflectional categories (e.g. TAM). \r
\r
Clause chains are often used to describe sequences of events, and the medial verbs involved may be marked by [special affixes to indicate temporal relationships](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB152). Clause chains may also include markers of [switch reference](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB151). Medial verbs in some languages may be marked in the usual way for person/number of their arguments, though they generally lack some other canonical verbal inflection or involve specific marked verb forms that cannot be used in freestanding clauses. \r
\r
There is considerable debate regarding the syntax of clause chaining generally and within individual languages. This construction is not merely a series of juxtaposed minimal clauses, as it requires dependency on one fully specified clause for full interpretation. It is also not straightforwardly a series of subordinated clauses (as in the series of temporal adjuncts in English, *Before he ate, while he was cooking the soup, he added salt.*). The syntactic relationship between clauses in clause chains is often described as a special type of coordination or a form of cosubordination.\r
\r
In some cases clause-chaining may be difficult to distinguish from [serial verb constructions](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB118). Remember that a serial verb construction involves a set of verbs or verb phrases that function as a single predicate, whereas clause-chaining involves a set of *clauses* with formally reduced verbs, all dependent on a single fully specified verb form. Clause-chaining is also different from [verb compounding](https://github.com/grambank/Grambank/wiki/GB122) in that the clauses in clause chaining are [phonologically independent](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Wordhood-and-phonological-boundness-or-independence) and express separate propositions, which is not the case for verb compounding. In cases where it is unclear which of these constructions is represented by the examples in the grammar, a ? may be coded, but be sure to indicate in the comments that you were unable to determine which of these constructions is demonstrated in the relevant examples.""" .

By clausal objects here we mean clauses that are directly governed by a finite verb (typically verbs of ‘wanting’, ‘saying’, etc.). In other words, complement clauses are a specific type of subordinate clauses and are not relative clauses. For example, the objects in _I like **apples**_ (nominal object) and _I like **that you play the piano every morning**_ (clausal object) are in the same position (SVO). Many of the languages that do not place clausal objects in the same position as nominal objects are SOV languages that use SVO order for (long) clausal objects. This question aims to discern whether these clausal objects are treated like prototypical nominal direct objects (not indirect or obliques).

The features on auxiliaries and particles cover more grammatical aspects than just perfective and imperfective. \r
\r
If this distinction is only available in some TAM-conditions, this counts as well. For example, if there is no aspectual distinction in the past but it only exists in the present, this still triggers a 1.""" .

\r
An indefinite article is a marker that accompanies the indefinite noun and expresses notions such as non-specificity and indefiniteness. Sometimes these notions of non-specificity and indefiniteness are summed up in the term ‘identifiability’. A language does not necessarily have both a non-specific/indefinite and a specific/definite marker. These markers often stem from very different sources (numerals and demonstratives) and need not be similar in formal expression or position. \r
\r
The formal expression is irrelevant; articles can be free, bound, or marked by suprasegmental markers such as tone. Articles are different from demonstratives in that demonstratives occur in a paradigm of markers that have a clear spatial deictic function. As demonstratives can grammaticalize into definite or specific articles, they form a natural continuum, making it hard to define discrete categories. Articles are more grammaticalized, i.e. are often [obligatory](https://github.com/grambank/grambank/wiki/Obligatoriness) in certain contexts that require definite or specific reference. Definite or specific articles can also grammaticalize from pronouns meaning ‘a certain’. As articles necessarily accompany nouns, it is in these cases that it is necessary to investigate whether the marker can occur independently or not; if it can it is most likely a pronoun and not an article. Articles can be homophonous with pronouns and demonstratives, and also with classifiers.""" .

\r
It can be hard to distinguish future tense from different modal categories, after all if something is in the future it has not yet occurred and can be construed as something wished for, planned, intended, etc. For this reason, it is necessary to pay particular attention to sections on mood, especially irrealis, when coding for future tense.\r
\r
If a language only has future tense under negation, this does not count for this feature. It needs to be present for affirmation as well. The reason for this is that conditions such as 'only under negation' are likely to give rise to quite different analysis by different linguists (hence it is hard to ensure comparability) and might also be overlooked. If we were to treat such marginal cases as triggering 1 we would most likely have to go back to a lot of the cases that were coded as 0 and re-evaluate their coding more thoroughly.""" .
